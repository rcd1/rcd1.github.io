                        <li>I've been running through FreeCodeCamp (I want to make this site cooler)</li>
                        <li>I <i>was</i> playing Terraria Calamity, but I tried rushing Moonlord after Golem (not smart)
                        </li>
                        <li>I watched Mushoku Tensei. I have never felt a stronger desire to get off my computer and go
                            touch grass, travel the world, join the Adventurer's Guild and make a name for myself.</li>
                        <li>You can imagine my despair when there were no Guilds here that would let me walk in, apply,
                            and start working that day.
                        <li>You can continue to imagine the pain of no wandering mages/warriors/adventurers to take my
                            under their tutelage, and no 1to1 equivalent to magic here that I could obsess over</li>
                        <li>I mean, in essence their system is sequential code executed by lossless transmutation.</li>
                        <li>But, it simply hasn't been proven that there is a renewable resource within ourselves that
                            we can convert into the "primitive" elements</li>
                        <li>I've found out that Publix has Popcorn Chicken, and different Publixes (Publi?) have
                            different flavors they serve.</li>
                        <li>I tried reading a couple days ago, and it was pretty nice. The last book I read was in 2020,

                        <li>I watched a youtube documentary about the Horse Race Tests, I just feel like we all could
                            use a little more doomed yuri in our lives.</li>

                            soon though.</li>
                        <li>I've almost finished Basic Html with FCC, so onto basic CSS</li>
                        <li>I am going to try a single LeetCode tomorrow, and I won't cry if I'm in the bottom 80% in
                            storage</li>
                        <li>I'm curious about Godot, and I found a <a
                                href="https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/?ref=godot-docs">website</a> that will

                            develop my own to 'enchant' my heirlooms with)</li>
                        <li>I noticed that I have a C++ program in here that I tried to make an .exe, but I don't think
                            it has a page, or works anymore</li>

                            repeat the past couple of days, I'll probably keep listening to it until I hate it.</li>
                        <li>I want some popcorn chicken. I'm gonna get some tomorrow.</li>
                        <li>I want a page for my thoughts, I've noticed writing things down keeps them from bouncing in
                            my head for weeks.</li>
