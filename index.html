                    <ul>
                        <li class="date"><h3>31/08/2025</h3></li>
                        <li>It's been a little while! I've mostly been getting used to being in school again.</li>
                        <li>My and my friends have been playing Overwatch 2, and we've been having a wonderful time (though the 27 loss streak was very painful).</li>
                        <li>I've discovered the <code>Home</code> and <code>End</code> keys on my keyboard, and combined with the <code>Ctrl + Shift + K</code> combo I can edit my programs so much faster.</li>
                        <li>It seems my physical health has moderately improved after not eating gas station and fast food multiple times each day. Veggie Dino-nugg sweep *^____^*</li>
                        <li>I've discovered hummus and I've been eating it alongside every meal and snack now.</li>
                        <li>I'm drinking a lot more diet soda. I can't remember where, something told me <quote>"the benefit of drinking diet soda is that you aren't drinking a regular soda"</quote>.</li>
                        <li>Haven't been leeting my code, even at school they are saying leetcode is "losing" its importance in the interview.</li>
                        <li>I made a game! I followed a tutorial to do most of it, but I want to do more.</li>
                        <li class="date"><h3>07/17/2025</h3></li>
                        <li>I heard about this thing called Touch Typing, and I would like to be able to type without looking at my keyboard as well. Apparently keyboards have been designed with this in mind by placing two strips on the J and F keys. They are there so you can always find your way back to the home base, and I haven't looked at my keyboard the same way since.</li>
                        <li>While driving at 5am to pick someone up, I stumbled upon the bands Yorushika and Kessoku Band. Holy shit they are incredible.</li>
                        <li>I left my job last week, and while prepping for this fall  I have also been doing some light searching on the usual suspects. I'm just going to grab something at the university and call it a day.</li>
                        <li>I have switched to diet soft drinks recently, and I have also been trying to drink as many water bottles as I can in a day. I have found that a pack of 32 16.9 oz bottles is like 5 bucks. Granted I could just drink tap, but it tastes a little funny and our ice also tastes a little funny and I like just drinking cold water and not crunching on the big ice because it can be really cold and not fun to crunch unless it's in the tiny crunchable size.</li>
                        <li>I found some dino nuggets at the Publix that boast a whooping 1/4 cup of vegetables in every serving of 4 nuggets. They were very tasty and I will be getting more and I will be looking into other frozen foods that hide veggies inside, they may be the meta.</li>
                        <li>The desire to be held grows stronger every day, just the thought of being pampered is making me dizzy.</li>
                        <li>Deltarune released, but as much as Undertale and Chapter 1 shaped my high school experience, I just can't find any desire to play the rest of the game. I do not think it is a bad game, it's just I grew up in the vibrant world of Undertale AUs, <a href="https://youtu.be/BCzDrlnOYY0?si=Xt5xYHHP7DpuikKm">GlitchTale</a> being my favorite. I guess I had my Toby Fox game that I hyperfixated on (and eventually grew past), I just don't know if Deltarune will spark the same renaissance I got to experience. That one Asgore gif is brilliant though.</li>
                        <li>I have found that I absolutely despise most react and gameplay content on YouTube. I just no longer care for the creator's experience with a piece of media, I want to experience these things for myself now that I have the means to do so.</li>
                        <li>I'm still making progress on LeetCode, and I've been jumping around on freeCodeCamp. I want to jump ahead to their Front End Libraries section (the part I want/need more experience with), but I should complete the sections before it first (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I just don't think I'm ready for the 1200 steps of CSS they have.</li>
                        <li>I watched a streamer play a gacha game called <em>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</em>, and I now have an interest in both learning Japanese and running. I haven't been on Duolingo for years now, and that bird let me have it when I logged back in. I have things set up to start running at the gym, just waiting on confirmation.</li>
                        <li>While scrolling though Reddit, I found a tome in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/">r/wizardposting</a> library with a predefined runeset for basic spells. I'll be using these once I find the time to collect the resources I will need. I'm planning a making a bangle first.</li>
                        <li>I was able to beat the Luminae Challenges! Challenge 3 was a nightmare, the others couldn't compare.</li>
                        <li class="date"><h3>07/12/2025</h3></li>
                        <li>I watched Dandadan today. I can't get those opening themes out of my head, so I'm veryexcited for the next season</li>
                        <li>I have been sitting outside a little bit every day, it would be pretty nice if it wasn't 90+ and humid. I keep hoping the next day will be cooler, one day it will be, I'm sure.</li>
                        <li>I have been wanting to bite something and/or someone quite often recently. My heart and my mouth are growing restless.</li>
                        <li>I have "started" toying with a sigillic language for magic circles. It's very early on inthe process, but I have created a few sigils at least. I've been working with a 3x3 grid andtrying to keep them at 3 connected strokes max per sigil. This way they take up at most 4 ofthe 9 dots in their grid. I'm thinking then the other five points could be modifiers thatcould be applied to the sigil. It could be neat to make a full alphabet to writeincantations in full sentences rather than the sum of elemental sigils and their effects,I do like both styles though. The only limit at this point is my motivation.</li>
                        <li>I was playing my Calamity world, and I beat Moon Lord! As it turns out, I also have Fargo'sSoul and Mutant mods, so I had spent a very long time crafting the Enchantments and theirForces. I was not happy to see my hard work reduced to nothing by the Champion Bosses thatjust happen to drop the very same enchantments I spent literal HOURS trying to create. Doyou know how long it took to get that lightning bug for the Hallowed? 5 HOURS. I HAD TO WAITFOR A NEW MOON AND HOPE THERE WAS ENOUGH WINDY HALLOWED GRASS FOR THAT BUG TO SPAWN. For anunrelated reason, I don't think I will be continuing my Calamity playthrough.</li>
                        <li>I did a LeetCode problem on that day I said I would try one, and now I'm up to doing acouple each day! I'm trying out their 30 Day JavaScript, 50 Programming Skills, and 75Interview Questions. I'm trying to do 1 problem per each day, and it's been fun relearningCSharp, actually learning JavaScript, and trying to solve these problems on my own. I havegotten some nifty solutions on my own, but I'm amazed at what other people create to.</li>
                        <li> I've been on E and Spiro for about 5 months now. With them, I have felt comfortable enoughto stop existing on autopilot. This has come with its own challenges: namely I had gottenusedto shutting down in stressful situations. I have been trying to work through those momentsinstead of ignoring them, and needless to say, they hurt. But I won't improve if can'thandle this, so it's one step at a time.</li>
                        <li>Youtube gave me another banger called <a href="https://youtu.be/PysVvOp0jiU?si=Bx0jDljCgTHz5WEQ">Ghost Avenue</a> by an artistcalled Eve. Incredible music video on its own, but I've never seen captions move like theydid here. Sadly though, Microsoft Edge can't handle all the effects Eve hadin mind, so Firefox might be in my future if I am willing to log back into my emails.</li>
                        <li class="date"><h3>07/04/2025</h3></li>
                        <li>I'm getting ready to start my CS Master's this fall</li>
                        <li>I've been running through FreeCodeCamp (I want to make this site cooler)</li>
                        <li>I <i>was</i> playing Terraria Calamity, but I tried rushing Moonlord after Golem (not smart)</li>
                        <li>I watched Mushoku Tensei. I have never felt a stronger desire to get off my computer and gotouch grass, travel the world, join the Adventurer's Guild and make a name for myself.</li>
                        <li>You can imagine my despair when there were no Guilds here that would let me walk in, apply,and start working that day.
                        <li>You can continue to imagine the pain of no wandering mages/warriors/adventurers to take myunder their tutelage, and no 1to1 equivalent to magic here that I could obsess over</li>
                        <li>I mean, in essence their system is sequential code executed by lossless transmutation.</li>
                        <li>But, it simply hasn't been proven that there is a renewable resource within ourselves thatwe can convert into the "primitive" elements</li>
                        <li>I've found out that Publix has Popcorn Chicken, and different Publixes (Publi?) havedifferent flavors they serve.</li>
                        <li>I tried reading a couple days ago, and it was pretty nice. The last book I read was in 2020,It's called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shapeshifters-Kieshara-Den-Shadows/dp/0385739508">TheShapeshifters</a> by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes</a></li>
                        <li>I watched a youtube documentary about the Horse Race Tests, I just feel like we all coulduse a little more doomed yuri in our lives.</li>

                        <li>I'm gonna muck around with Blender and Godot again (Unity is just so bloated nowadays)</li>

                        <li>I do want some more popcorn chicken, but I also found these really crunchy crackers the make my brain happy when i crunch and crunch and crunch and so i might get some more. Though I have been craving some crispy and juicy steak. </li>

                        <li>I think eventually I want a separate page for our talks here, but like... I can just write them here... so it is not a high priority.</li>
