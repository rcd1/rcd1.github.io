                        <li>I watched Dandadan today. I can't get those opening themes out of my head, so I'm very
                            excited for the next season</li>
                        <li>I have been sitting outside a little bit every day, it would be pretty nice if it wasn't 90+ and humid. I keep hoping the next day will be cooler, one day it will be, I'm sure.</li>
                        <li>I have been wanting to bite something and/or someone quite often recently. My heart and my mouth are growing restless.</li>
                        <li>I have "started" toying with a sigillic language for magic circles. It's very early on in
                            the process, but I have created a few sigils at least. I've been working with a 3x3 grid and
                            trying to keep them at 3 connected strokes max per sigil. This way they take up at most 4 of
                            the 9 dots in their grid. I'm thinking then the other five points could be modifiers that
                            could be applied to the sigil. It could be neat to make a full alphabet to write
                            incantations in full sentences rather than the sum of elemental sigils and their effects,
                            I do like both styles though. The only limit at this point is my motivation.</li>
                        <li>I was playing my Calamity world, and I beat Moon Lord! As it turns out, I also have Fargo's
                            Soul and Mutant mods, so I had spent a very long time crafting the Enchantments and their
                            Forces. I was not happy to see my hard work reduced to nothing by the Champion Bosses that
                            just happen to drop the very same enchantments I spent literal HOURS trying to create. Do
                            you know how long it took to get that lightning bug for the Hallowed? 5 HOURS. I HAD TO WAIT
                            FOR A NEW MOON AND HOPE THERE WAS ENOUGH WINDY HALLOWED GRASS FOR THAT BUG TO SPAWN. For an
                            unrelated reason, I don't think I will be continuing my Calamity playthrough.</li>
                        <li>I did a LeetCode problem on that day I said I would try one, and now I'm up to doing a
                            couple each day! I'm trying out their 30 Day JavaScript, 50 Programming Skills, and 75
                            Interview Questions. I'm trying to do 1 problem per each day, and it's been fun relearning
                            CSharp, actually learning JavaScript, and trying to solve these problems on my own. I have
                            gotten some nifty solutions on my own, but I'm amazed at what other people create to.</li>
                        <li> I've been on E and Spiro for about 5 months now. With them, I have felt comfortable enough
                            to stop existing on autopilot. This has come with its own challenges: namely I had gotten
                            used
                            to shutting down in stressful situations. I have been trying to work through those moments
                            instead of ignoring them, and needless to say, they hurt. But I won't improve if can't
                            handle this, so it's one step at a time.</li>
                        <li>Youtube gave me another banger called <a
                                href="https://youtu.be/PysVvOp0jiU?si=Bx0jDljCgTHz5WEQ">Ghost Avenue</a> by an artist
                            called Eve. Incredible music video on its own, but I've never seen captions move like they
                            did here. Sadly though, Microsoft Edge can't handle all the effects Eve had
                            in mind, so Firefox might be in my future if I am willing to log back into my emails.</li>

                        <li>I watched Mushoku Tensei. I have never felt a stronger desire to get off my computer and go
                            touch grass, travel the world, join the Adventurer's Guild and make a name for myself.</li>
                        <li>You can imagine my despair when there were no Guilds here that would let me walk in, apply,
                            and start working that day.
                        <li>You can continue to imagine the pain of no wandering mages/warriors/adventurers to take my
                            under their tutelage, and no 1to1 equivalent to magic here that I could obsess over</li>

                        <li>But, it simply hasn't been proven that there is a renewable resource within ourselves that

                        <li>I've found out that Publix has Popcorn Chicken, and different Publixes (Publi?) have

                        <li>I tried reading a couple days ago, and it was pretty nice. The last book I read was in 2020,
