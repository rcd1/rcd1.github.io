                Our project will be some form of game for Windows computers, developed in the Unity Game Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Current plan for the game (subject to change):
                3D platforming game made in Unity. The concept will be simple, but have
                unique mechanics to help it stand out. We will learn some amount
                of Blender to create models for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given a character that can walk, run, jump, and interact with the environment, the player must
                navigate through increasingly difficult geometry, solve puzzles, and avoid/defeat enemies in order
                to reach the end. As the player progresses the character will find temporary powerups and/or
                permanent tools that will improve the character's capability.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start we'll be using C# and Unity Game Engine's Scripting API. The IDE that is recommended
                for Unity is Visual Studio 2019 or above, Unity includes its own package manager, and Unity already
                includes the libraries necessary for us to implement the goals above as well as potential future
                goals such as persistent data through JSON.
